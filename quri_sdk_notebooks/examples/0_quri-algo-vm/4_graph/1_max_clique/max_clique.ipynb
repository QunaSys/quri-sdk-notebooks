    "# Max Clique problem\n",
    "Max clique problem is a classic NP-hard problem in Graph theory. The goal is to find the largest clique (a subset of vertices that form a complete subgraph) in a given undirected graph. <br>\n",
    "This problem has applications in various fields, including:\n",
    "* **Social network analysis**: Idnetifying highly connected communities.\n",
    "* **Financial markets**: Detecting highly correlated asset groups for risk assessment and portfolio diversification.\n",
    "* **Bioinformatics**: Detecting modules in protein-protein interaction networks.\n",

    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "Given a undirected graph **G=(V, E)** , where **V** is the set of vertices, **E** is the set of edges, representing connections between vertices. <br>\n",
    "The objective is to find the largest clique **C** $\\subseteq$ **V**, such that for any two vertices **u, v** $\\in$ **C**, the edge (u, v) exists in **E**.\n",
