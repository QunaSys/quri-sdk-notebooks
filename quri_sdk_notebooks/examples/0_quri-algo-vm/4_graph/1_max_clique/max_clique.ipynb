    "# Max Clique problem\n",
    "Max clique problem is a classic NP-hard problem in Graph theory. The goal is to find the largest clique (a subset of vertices that form a complete subgraph) in a given undirected graph. <br>\n",
    "This problem has applications in various fields, including:\n",
    "* **Social network analysis**: Idnetifying highly connected communities.\n",
    "* **Financial markets**: Detecting highly correlated asset groups for risk assessment and portfolio diversification.\n",
    "* **Bioinformatics**: Detecting modules in protein-protein interaction networks.\n",

    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "Given a undirected graph **G=(V, E)** , where **V** is the set of vertices, **E** is the set of edges, representing connections between vertices. <br>\n",
    "The objective is to find the largest clique **C** $\\subseteq$ **V**, such that for any two vertices **u, v** $\\in$ **C**, the edge (u, v) exists in **E**.\n",

    "Transforming Max Clique into a QUBO Hamiltonian allows us to leverage quantum and classical optimizers alike to efficiently search for the subset that forms the maximum clique. <br>\n",

    "1. $-\\alpha \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$:  \n",
    "   This term rewards including more vertices in the solution. We use a negative sign because we want to **minimize** the Hamiltonian, so a larger $\\sum x_i$ lowers the overall energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $\\beta \\sum_{\\substack{(i,j)\\notin E \\\\ i<j}} x_i x_j$:  \n",
    "   As a clique requires every pair of chosen vertices to be adjacent, we penalize pairs $(i,j)$ not in $E$. If both $x_i$ and $x_j$ are 1 but $(i,j)\\notin E$, this increases the energy. Thus $\\beta > 0$ is a **penalty** factor discouraging invalid pairs.\n",

    "   This **weighted reward** term encourages choosing vertices with higher weights. Because we are **minimizing** $H_{\\text{WMC}}$, the negative sign helps increase the total weight of selected vertices as much as possible. The parameter $\\alpha$ determines how strongly we value the weights relative to the penalty term.\n",

    "   This **penalty** term ensures that any pair of vertices $(i,j)$ not connected by an edge will raise the energy if both are selected. Thus, $\\lambda$ must be large enough to prevent choosing non‐adjacent vertices simultaneously, preserving the clique property."
