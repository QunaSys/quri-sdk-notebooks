    "# Graph Isomorphism Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Graph Isomorphism (GI) problem is a well-known problem in theoretical computer science and combinatorics. Unlike NP-complete problems, GI is in NP but has not been proven to be either in P or NP-complete, making it a fascinating intermediate problem.  \n",
    "The goal is to determine whether two given graphs are structurally identical, meaning there exists a bijective mapping between their vertex sets that preserves edge connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem has applications in various fields, including:\n",
    "* **Chemistry**: Checking whether two molecular graphs represent the same compound.\n",
    "* **Pattern recognition**: Matching structural patterns in images or graphs.\n",
    "* **Cryptography**: Designing protocols based on the hardness of GI.\n",
